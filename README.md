# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview
We are working with a non-profit organization named Alphabet soup. Their mission is to protect the environment, improve wellbeing, and unify the world. Unfortunately, some take their donations then disappear. We are brought in to help build a model that predicts which organizations are worth donating to, and which are too high risk.
